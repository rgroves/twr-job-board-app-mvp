These are my notes as I walk through this tutorial: https://youtu.be/lauywdXKEXI

- I need to familiarize myself with Material UI

  - The tutorial uses @material-ui/core@next. I wasn't sure what the @ signs in
    the pacakge name were for.

    - The leading @ signifies a scope (e.g. @material-ui/). Scopes are a way of
      grouping related packages together, and also affect a few things about the
      way npm treats the package.

      see: https://docs.npmjs.com/using-npm/scope.html

    - The npm page states "Please note that @next will only point to 
      pre-releases; to get the latest stable releaseuse @latest instead."

    - "next" is just a tag. On the npm registry page for the package, in the
      versions tab you can see the tags that are set to "next" and "latest" 
      for that package.
