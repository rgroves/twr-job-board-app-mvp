These are my notes as I walk through this tutorial: https://youtu.be/lauywdXKEXI

- I need to familiarize myself more with Material UI
  - see: https://material-ui.com/

- The tutorial uses @material-ui/core@next. I wasn't sure what the @ signs in
  the pacakge name were for.

  - The leading @ signifies a scope (e.g. @material-ui/). Scopes are a way of
    grouping related packages together, and also affect a few things about the
    way npm treats the package.

    see: https://docs.npmjs.com/using-npm/scope.html

  - The npm package page states "Please note that @next will only point to 
    pre-releases; to get the latest stable releaseuse @latest instead."

  - "next" is just a tag. On the npm registry page for the package, in the
    versions tab you can see the tags that are set to "next" and "latest" for
    that package.

- Regarding app design:
  - Want App.js just to hold state, so making separate components: 
    - Jobs.js will hold component tree and render styling
    - Job.js will hold application state, use state, and call hooks

- My styling of the job list was different than in the tutorial.

  - There seemed to be a box shadow around the entries in the tutorialâ€”
    I'm chalking that up to a difference in the Typography library (?)

  - The title and company were right up against one another (e.g. "SWE 1Google")

  - I added span tags around the title and company which got my list to look
    similar to the tutorial's list.
